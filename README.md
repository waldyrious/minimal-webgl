# Minimal WebGL

The minimal code to get a WebGL canvas showing a simple object.
Most defaults are left alone
  (perspective is orthographic, no transformations applied, etc.)
  to make the code as approachable as possible.
A single square is shown, at the center of the canvas.
  The `vertices` array can be changed to show a different shape,
  and the `color` array edited to change the object's color.

This code was heavily inspired by [@guciek](https://github.com/guciek)'s
[Shortest WebGL example](https://sites.google.com/site/progyumming/javascript/shortest-webgl),
but aims to be a fully documented such example (using [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/)),
rather than just the code. (Issue #2)
